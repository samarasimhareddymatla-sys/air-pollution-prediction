## Overview
Air pollution is a growing concern that impacts human health, climate, and the economy.  
This project uses **machine learning techniques** to:
- Predict AQI (Air Quality Index) based on historical pollutant data.
- Identify regions with consistently poor air quality.
- Generate insights through visualizations for policymakers and the public.

## Project Objectives
- **Accurate AQI Prediction:** Forecast AQI values using supervised ML models.
- **Hotspot Detection:** Identify high-pollution regions and visualize them.
- **Data Insights:** Provide actionable insights through EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
- **Scalable Solution:** Codebase designed to work with large real-world datasets.

## Key Features
 **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, outliers, and normalization  
 **Machine Learning Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, and other ML techniques  
 **Visualization:** Interactive graphs for AQI trends and pollutant contribution  
 **Hotspot Analysis:** Identifies top affected areas  
 **Optimized Code:** Well-structured, modular, and reusable  

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:**  
  - **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy  
  - **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
  - **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
